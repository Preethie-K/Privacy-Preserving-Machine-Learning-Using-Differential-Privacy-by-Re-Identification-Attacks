# Privacy-Preserving-Machine-Learning-Using-Differential-Privacy-by-Re-Identification-Attacks


A re-identification attack, often referred to as a re-identification risk is a privacy breach in which an individual's supposedly anonymized or de-identified data is used to identify or re-identify them. This occurs when an attacker, through various means, is able to link an anonymized dataset to an individual, thereby revealing the person's identity or sensitive information. Re-identification attacks can compromise privacy and confidentiality, especially in contexts where organizations or researchers collect and release data for analysis, but they want to protect the identities of individuals in the dataset.This concept is implemented the project to preserve the privacy of the given data.
